  ## Health and Stamina

  Stamina is a replenishable resource that depletes during combat or from other
  harmful effects. It can be restored during periods of rest, from first aid, or
  from other restorative actions.

  Health is a finite resource that cannot be regenerated except by
  hospitalization or expert treatment. When you run out of stamina, further
  damage will affect your health. When any of your health pool is depleted, you
  are wounded, and your stamina regenerates at half the normal rate.

  ### Regaining Stamina

  During missions, your characters can take quick breaks to regain stamina. You
  have two dice per mission that you can roll to regain stamina, plus another
  dice for each bonus you have for Tough. For example, if you had a +2 Tough
  bonus, you could roll 4d6 over the course of a mission to regain stamina.

  You can choose to roll dice individually or all at once to regain stamina, but
  once you've rolled them all, that's it unless your character spends a full
  night sleeping. A full night's sleep recovers all stamina and resets the
  number of dice you have back to normal.

  If you are wounded, halve your dice rolls, rounded down, and a full night's
  sleep will only recover half of your stamina, rounded down.

  #### First Aid

  To heal during combat, you can choose to apply first aid instead of attacking.
  Roll a Cool check, then roll to determine how much stamina is recovered. On a
  mixed success, roll 1d6. On a success, roll 2d6. On a critical success, roll
  4d6. If you have a +2 or higher Cool bonus, add another dice to your roll.
  Health cannot be restored from first aid.

  You can apply first aid once per turn in combat, but outside of combat, you
  can only apply first aid after a character takes damage. Once they've been
  tended to, that's as much good as first aid can do until they get hurt again.

  ### Regaining Health

  Health can only be regained through hospitalization or expert treatment. Some
  classes or NPCs may be able to provide treatment in the field, but for the
  most part, healing needs to happen between missions.
  
  Mechanically speaking, a Medic or NPC would need to roll a Cool check to
  determine their ability to heal. On a mixed success, they would roll 1d6 to
  determine how much health recovered. On a success, they would roll 2d6.

  If you lose all of your health, you must make death saving throws to determine
  whether you live or die.

  ### Death Saving Throws

  There is no stat associated with death saving throws. You must make 3
  successful rolls to live, but if you fail 3 times, your character dies. A
  critical failure counts as two failures and a critical success counts as two
  successes. A 6 or lower counts as a failure as usual, but an 8 or higher
  counts as a success.

  On a 7, you have a choice. You may choose to add a success or remove a
  failure, but if you do so, you must make the next roll with disadvantage. You
  may also choose to treat a 7 as neither a success or failure, and simply roll
  again.

  If you succeed 3 times, you become stable, but you can't take any actions
  until you've been healed up to at least one health point.
