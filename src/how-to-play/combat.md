  ## Combat

  Rather than strictly following the normal failure, mixed success, and success
  pattern of normal exploration rolls, combat has special mechanics. It's not as
  involved as other RPG systems, but it follows similar principles.

  ### Initiative

  Enemies don't get turns of their own in this system, but instead, they react
  to the players' actions as they happen. As such, the turn order between
  players doesn't matter all that much, but it can be helpful to set an order to
  focus the action, rather than having the same characters attack repeatedly
  while others just sort of hang out nearby.

  That said, trying to exploit this mechanic won't prevent the enemy from
  attacking you. If you're in a situation where the bad guys want to kill you
  and you decide to just ignore them, it is well within the GM's rights to roll
  attacks and deal damage, regardless of player actions up to that point.

  Depending on your group's preferences, you may choose to pick the order
  randomly by rolling dice, or players could volunteer to go first, second,
  third, etc. Then, as combat goes on, each player goes in order and the cycle
  repeats until the combat encounter is over.

  There are also no set limits on how much stuff a character can do during their
  turn. If it's something that would obviously take a long time, that can be
  something that goes on in the background while other players take their turns
  for a while. It's not a big deal, so you can work out something that feels
  right for your group.

  ### Attacking

  On a player's turn, if they choose to attack, they roll with their Tough
  modifier. On a failure, they deal no damage but take 2d6 damage from the enemy
  they're fighting. On a mixed success, they deal 1d6 damage but also take 1d6
  damage from the enemy. On a success, they deal 2d6 damage and take no damage
  in return.

  Critical failures deal an extra 2d6 damage to the player from the enemy (4d6
  total), and critical successes deal an extra 2d6 damage to the enemy.

  Certain weapons do not deal damage, but instead, they have special effects,
  such as restraining, blinding, or stunning enemies. If using those weapons,
  ignore the damage dice dealt to the enemy (the player may still take damage),
  and use the level of success to determine how effective that special effect
  is. For example, a mixed success from a net gun attack might mean that the
  enemy has its legs wrapped up in the net, but their hands are free and they
  still have access to their weapons.

  ### Defending

  Either in anticipation of an attack or as a reaction to one, players may
  choose to protect somebody else by rolling with their Tough modifier. On a
  failure, they and the target they're protecting both take full damage. On a
  mixed success, they and the target they're protecting both take half damage.
  On a success, they take half damage, and the target they're protecting takes
  no damage. On a critical success, they and the target both take no damage.
