  ## Combat

  Rather than strictly following the normal failure, mixed success, and success
  pattern of normal exploration rolls, combat has special mechanics. It's not as
  involved as other RPG systems, but it follows similar principles.

  ### Initiative

  When it is obvious that combat is happening, whether from an ambush or
  somebody attacking, all the players will roll initiative. There is no stat
  modifier â€“ this just establishes the order in which players or enemies will
  attack. Whoever rolled highest goes first, then the next highest and so on. In
  the event of a tie, roll again until one roll is higher than the other to
  determine who goes first.

  Working through the initiative order, each player or enemy will take a turn
  where they can attack or take some other actions of their choosing. There are
  no rigid movement restrictions or limits on what can happen during a turn,
  other than players can only attack once per turn. Everything else will be up
  to GM discretion to decide what's allowed during a single turn.

  Once the last player or enemy in the order has taken their turn, the round of
  combat is over, and the next round starts with the person at the top of the
  order. Keep cycling through the order until the conflict is resolved, either
  violently, peacefully, or somewhere in between.

  ### Attacking

  On a player's turn, if they choose to attack, they roll with their Tough
  modifier for most weapons, or whichever modifier best applies for the weapon
  they are using, such as Sharp for a sniper rifle. On a failure, they deal no
  damage or special effects based on their weapon. On mixed success and success
  rolls, they deal damage based on whatever weapon they are using and apply
  special effects accordingly. This typically means half as much damage or
  effect on mixed success rolls, compared to successful rolls.

  On critical failures, the attack backfires and the player takes the equivalent
  of whatever their weapon does on a mixed success. On critical successes, the
  damage dice and any special effects are doubled. For example, on a shotgun
  attack, the primary target would take 4d6 damage, and adjacent targets would
  take 2d6 damage.

  Certain weapons do not deal damage, but instead, they have special effects,
  such as restraining, blinding, or stunning enemies. For example, a mixed
  success from a net gun attack might mean that the enemy has its legs wrapped
  up in the net, but their hands are free and they still have access to their
  weapons.

  Enemies also make attack rolls and deal damage according to the same rules as
  the players. It is up to the GM how they want to handle modifiers and the
  actions of multiple NPCs. They may choose to have henchmen attack as a pack
  and only roll once, applying the damage equally, or they may want to roll
  individually for every NPC.

  ### Defending

  Either in anticipation of an attack or as a reaction to one, players may
  choose to protect somebody else by rolling with their Tough modifier. On a
  failure, they and the target they're protecting both take full damage. On a
  mixed success, they and the target they're protecting both take half damage.
  On a success, they take half damage, and the target they're protecting takes
  no damage. On a critical success, they and the target both take no damage. As
  a general rule, a player can only defend once per round.
