  ## How To Play

  Spacedoor is a tabletop RPG in the same vein as [Monster of the
  Week](https://www.evilhat.com/home/monster-of-the-week/) or [Apocalypse
  World](http://www.apocalypse-world.com/). It's designed to be played by 4-6
  players, but those aren't hard limits.

  Most players will create characters that are the central characters in the
  game. They can be anything from elite warriors or brilliant scientists to
  aliens, robots, or ghosts. The characters will be responsible for exploring
  the galaxy via the Spacedoor, making first contact with other cultures,
  fighting off alien invasions, gathering new technologies, and handling
  whatever sci-fi adventures come up along the way.

  One player will be the Keeper, or DM, or GM (whatever term you want, really),
  and they will act as a sort of narrator. They will describe the settings,
  portray non-player characters (NPCs), and react to the player characters'
  (PCs) actions. It is usually the Keeper's job to come up with the missions
  that the PCs need to complete.

  ### What You'll Need

  Each game needs a Keeper and ideally 3-5 players. Players will need:
  - A character sheet to keep track of stats, health, luck, weapons, armor, and
    feats
  - Pencils and paper, or a notebook (or equivalent digital tools)
  - 2 or more 6 sided dice (or a digital dice roller) â€“ Note: dice will commonly
    be referred to in a format like "2d6". The 2 represents the number of dice
    to roll, and the 6 represents how many sides the dice should have, so 2d6
    means to roll two six sided dice.

  The Keeper will need:
  - A reference sheet or notes about the mission
  - Dice of their own (they may want more polyhedral dice to introduce more
    randomness into the game)
  - Prepared names for NPCs (or a random name generator)

  ### What You Need To Know

  The Keeper should be familiar with all the rules and the sort of situations
  that each stat is used for. They should also read the recommendations for
  creating scenarios. This system is fairly light on rules, so even
  surface-level familiarity should be enough to get started.

  Players should read the descriptions of the classes that interest them, then
  choose one to play as. As a general rule, there should only be one player of a
  certain class per group, but you can disregard that rule if your group has a
  cool concept.
  
  They'll also need to look at weapons, armor, feats, and the rules for health
  and stamina. The character creation process should introduce them to the main
  concepts, though, so by creating a character, they should be good to go.

  ### Basic Gameplay

  The game generally flows like this. The Keeper will describe a setting or a
  situation, then the players will react to that by describing what they want to
  do, such as investigating an alien artifact. The Keeper will occasionally ask
  players to roll against stats to determine how successful they are. The
  players will roll 2d6 (most of the time), add their bonus, and tell the Keeper
  what they got.

  For the most part, a 6 or lower is a failure, a 7-9 is a mixed success, and a
  10 or higher is a success. Snake eyes, or when both dice land on 1, mean a
  critical failure. Two sixes, on the other hand, mean a critical success. It's
  up to the Keeper to determine what happens based on the level of success or
  failure.
  
  The Keeper will respond to the players' actions, then repeat the cycle by
  describing what happens as the result. There are other mechanics that can
  change this basic flow, such as during combat or as the result of a class
  feat, but that's essentially it.

  ### Making Your Own Rules

  This game is intended to be flexible, so if you need to make up a new rule to
  handle a specific situation, like if your low-level players somehow managed to
  steal a spaceship, that's totally fine. As long as the group is fine with
  making rule changes or adding feats or equipment, it's all good. Have fun with
  it.
