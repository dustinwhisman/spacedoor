  ## Advantage, Disadvantage, and Helping Out

  Typical gameplay will involve just the straightforward rolls, but there are
  some mechanics that can change the basic gameplay, if only for a roll.

  ### Advantage and Disadvantage

  At certain times, either from the GM's discretion or because of a feat or
  character ability, players will roll with either advantage or disadvantage,
  making rolls more or less likely to succeed, respectively.

  When rolling with advantage, roll 3d6 and drop the lowest number rolled. For
  example, if you rolled a 3, a 2, and a 6, you would drop the 2, leaving you
  with a roll of 9.

  When rolling with disadvantage, roll 3d6 and drop the highest number rolled.
  That would change the result of the previous example to a 5, since the 6 would
  have been dropped instead of the 2.

  To see how that works, or to handle the majority of your rolls, you can use
  the [dice roller](/dice-roller).

  ### Helping Out

  For most situations, only one player may roll to do the same action â€“
  otherwise, the chance of failure for most actions would be minimal. However,
  other players may roll to help out if the original roll was just under what
  they wanted.

  To help out, other players must roll against the same stat as the original
  roll. On a failure, the original roll decreases by one. On a mixed success,
  the original roll increases by one. On a success, the player who made the
  original check can choose to either add 1d6 to their original roll or reroll
  the check with advantage.

  On a critical failure, the original roll becomes a failure and is unable to be
  helped. On a critical success, the original roll becomes a critical success.
