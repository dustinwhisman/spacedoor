  ## Character Creation

  The first step to starting your game is creating characters. Follow this guide
  to create a level one character. To start at a higher level, follow this
  guide, then read about leveling up.

  ### Stats

  There are 5 stats that determine the skill levels of each character in
  different areas. The stats are as follows:

  - **Charm**: used for convincing people, deceiving people, negotiating,
    seduction – pretty much anything where words and body language are enough to
    accomplish the goal
  - **Cool**: used for doing difficult, stressful, or dangerous tasks – anything
    where remaining calm under pressure would be key
  - **Sharp**: used for observation and investigation – covers situational
    awareness, studying the environment, or studying objects or clues
  - **Tough**: used for fighting and defending, plus feats of strength –
    anything physically taxing or related to dealing or taking damage
  - **Technobabble**: used for interacting with, understanding, or using
    unfamiliar technology – plugging a MacBook into an alien mothership, for
    example

  Each class has a primary stat, a secondary stat, and a penalty stat, which are
  listed under the class descriptions. The primary and secondary stats both
  start at +1, and the penalty stat starts at -1. Other stats start at 0. In
  addition to that, you have one free boost and one penalty to assign.

  For example, The Diplomat has Charm as its primary stat, Sharp as its
  secondary stat, and Tough as its penalty stat. That means Charm and Sharp
  would both start at +1, Tough would start at -1, and Cool and Technobabble
  would start at 0. With the extra boost and penalty, you could choose to
  balance out your other stats by bumping Cool to +1 and reducing Technobabble
  to -1, or you could fully min/max your character, bumping Charm to +2 and
  dropping Tough down to -2.

  ### Subclasses

  Each class also has subclasses, which add more flavor to the character and add
  special abilities, mechanics, or restrictions to the character. Choose one,
  and make a note of the special effects caused by the subclass.

  ### Health and Stamina

  Level one characters all start with 3 health and 9 stamina. [Health and
  stamina](/how-to-play/health-and-stamina) are effectively hit points. You take
  damage from fighting or from hostile environments, which wears down your
  stamina until you start to lose health. Stamina recovers relatively easily,
  but health represents more serious injuries or wounds.

  Record your max health and max stamina and reserve a space for your current
  health and stamina pools, so you can keep track during combat or other
  encounters.

  ### Luck Points

  Each character starts with 7 Luck points. They can be used to turn any roll
  into a success, or they can be used to reduce damage taken to zero. Luck is a
  non-replenishable resource, so save it for situations where the consequences
  of failure would be devastating.

  Your character sheet should have 7 boxes to keep track of Luck. Each time you
  burn a Luck point, check one of the boxes.

  ### Weapons and Armor

  Before each mission, you can choose two [weapons](/weapons) to take with you.
  There are a number of weapons that any character can use, but there are some
  that require certain stats before they can be used. Check the list and see
  which weapons make sense for your character to start out with. You can always
  swap them out before the next mission or if there's a valid in-story reason to
  resupply.

  Your character's stats also determine what [armor](/armor) you can wear.
  Different types of armor offer different benefits, so check the list to see
  what you can use to start out with. Generally speaking, you will always want
  to wear the best armor for each stat that you can.

  ### Feats

  Each time you level up, you get to choose either a [general feat](/feats) or a
  class feat that is specific to your character's class. You don't get to choose
  a feat to start with, but leveling up happens quickly in this game, so check
  the lists to see what you might want to take once you level up.

  ### Details and Flavor

  The rules and feats mostly describe how the characters work, mechanically.
  It's up to you to decide what your character's backstory, motivations,
  physical characteristics, and other details are. If you like, you can work out
  what the character's relationship to the other PCs are before starting, or you
  can just start playing and see what dynamics emerge.

  ### Experience and Leveling Up

  Every time you fail a roll, you gain one experience point. You also get
  experience from successfully completing missions. It takes 5 experience points
  to level up. Once you level up, you roll for increased health and stamina, and
  you get to choose a new feat.

  When you level up, roll 2d6 plus your Tough bonus (treat negative Tough as 0).
  Of the two dice rolled, the lower number goes toward health, and the higher
  number goes toward stamina. You may choose to add your bonus to either health
  or stamina. For example, if you had a +2 Tough bonus, and you rolled a 3 and a
  4, the 3 would be added to your health pool, and the 4 would be added to your
  stamina pool. Then you could choose to add 2 to either health or stamina, or
  split it between both.
