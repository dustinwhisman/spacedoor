  ## Make Your Mark On The Galaxy

  An ancient device has been discovered buried under the ruins of an ancient
  civilization. After decades of scientific experiments and a little trial and
  error, it is discovered that it has the ability to connect wormholes to
  identical devices throughout the galaxy. It's like a gate between stars, or
  a... space door, if you will.

  Your government has kept this device secret and has assembled elite teams to
  explore newly discovered planets. These teams are responsible for gaining
  allies, gathering resources and advanced technologies, and guarding against
  threats from all corners of the galaxy.

  Spacedoor is a standalone sci-fi action adventure RPG for 4-6 people. Take
  down hostile aliens as a military strike force, study cultures and societies
  as a group of diplomats and scholars, come to a deeper understanding of the
  universe, or do some light colonialism.

  Everything you need to know to play the game, as well as tools to help you run
  the game or randomize mission scenarios, can be found here.
