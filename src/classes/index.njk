    Classes
  </h2>
  <p>
    These are the official classes that players can choose to play as. Each
    class has a primary stat, secondary stat, and penalty stat, and they each
    have specific class feats that can be chosen as they level up. Each class
    has subclass options, which give them specific abilities or restrictions
    that help guide their actions in the game. If you want to paint outside the
    lines and play as something else, work with your GM to come up with a class
    and feats that work for your concept.
