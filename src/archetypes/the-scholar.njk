  <h3>
    The Scholar
  </h3>
  <p class="font-style:italic">
    You've studied ancient civilizations, religions, languages, and cultures
    for your whole professional career. You were made for first contact
    situations, and you can understand ruins, artifacts, and customs more
    quickly than anybody.
  </p>
  <p>
    To make your Scholar, first pick a name, gender/pronouns, age, and a general
    look. Then follow the instructions below to decide your ratings, moves, and
    gear. Finally, introduce yourself and pick history.

      someone)
    </li>

      <strong>Puzzle solver</strong>: Your knowledge, combined with problem
      solving skills lets you figure out riddles, puzzles, and tests more easily
