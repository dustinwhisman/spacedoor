  <h3>
    The Diplomat
  </h3>
  <p class="font-style:italic">
    Not every mission has to end with gunfire or a high speed getaway. You
    use your charm and your tact to defuse tense situations, win people over,
    and maintain relationships with your allies. You're a great negotiator,
    and you know how to get what you need through conversation.
  </p>
  <p>
    To make your Diplomat, first pick a name, gender/pronouns, age, and a general
    look. Then follow the instructions below to decide your ratings, moves, and
    gear. Finally, introduce yourself and pick history. You can build your own
    dossier if you have a lot of custom rules, or you can print the standard
    version and fill in the blanks.

  <h4>
    Moves
  </h4>
  <p class="font-style:italic">
    You get all the basic moves, plus three Diplomat moves.
  </p>
  <p class="font-style:italic">
    Pick three of these:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>
      <strong>Calming touch</strong>: You can diffuse tense interactions more
      easily than most (+1 act under pressure)
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Gesture of goodwill</strong>: If you give something of value to
      someone, they are more likely to help you (a 7-9 is treated like 10+
      manipulate someone)
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Carry a big stick</strong>: If negotiations break down, you're
      prepared to defend yourself (+1 kick some ass, protect someone)
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Home field advantage</strong>: If you are on your home planet, you
      have the upper hand in negotiations (+1 manipulate someone)
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Gentle approach</strong>: Use empathy and compassion rather than
      intimidation to get information from people (+1 investigate, read a bad
      situation)
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Cooler heads</strong>: Keeping calm has an effect on your allies
      (+1 help out)
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Tough negotiator</strong>: Talk your way out of life or death
      situations (+1 act under pressure)
    </li>
  </ul>
