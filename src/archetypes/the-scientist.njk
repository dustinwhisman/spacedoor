  <h3>
    The Scientist
  </h3>
  <p class="font-style:italic">
    You're an expert in math, physics, chemistry, and biology. If anybody can
    reverse engineer advanced technologies, it's you. If there's a weird
    phenomenon that can be explained through scientific reasoning, you can
    figure it out faster than most.
  </p>
  <p>
    To make your Scientist, first pick a name, gender/pronouns, age, and a general
    look. Then follow the instructions below to decide your ratings, moves, and
    gear. Finally, introduce yourself and pick history.
  </p>
  {% include "dossier/ratings.njk" %}

  <h4>
    Moves
  </h4>
  <p class="font-style:italic">
    You get all the basic moves, plus three Scientist moves.
  </p>
  <p class="font-style:italic">
    Pick three of these:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>
      <strong>Anomalous readings</strong>: Your equipment helps alert you when
      something isn't normal (+1 investigate, read a bad situation)
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Well, in theory...</strong> If someone suggest a crazy idea, you
      can usually figure out how to make it work (+1 reverse the polarity)
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Reverse engineering</strong>: You can pick apart alien technology
      and figure out how it works (+1 investigate on technology)
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Scientific authority</strong>: You can convince others that
      something good or bad will happen based on current evidence (+1 manipulate
      someone)
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Backseat driver</strong>: You can walk someone through how to do
      technical tasks if you're not there (+1 help out)
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Mad scientist</strong>: You've always got some crazy gadget that
      you cooked up in the lab that you can use in a pinch (+1 kick some ass,
      protect someone)
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Accuracy and precision</strong>: When you're in the zone, you can
      do complicated tasks quickly and perfectly (when you successfully act
      under pressure, you get an automatic 12 on your next reverse the polarity
      roll)
    </li>
  </ul>

  <h4>
    Gear
  </h4>
  <p class="font-style:italic">
    You get a standard issue sidearm: 9mm handgun (2 harm, close, loud). Then
    you may pick a serious weapon and either armor or special equipment.
  </p>
  <p class="font-style:italic">
    Serious weapons (pick one):
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>
      Submachine gun (3 harm, close, area, loud, reload)
    </li>
    <li>
      Stun gun (1 harm, close, stun)
    </li>
    <li>
      Core sample drill (2 harm, close, slow, messy)
    </li>
    <li>
      Tranquilizer gun (1 harm, close, stun, useful)
    </li>
  </ul>
  <p class="font-style:italic">
    Armor and special equipment (pick one):
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>
      Flak jacket (2 armor, heavy)
    </li>
    <li>
      Protective vest (1 armor, light)
    </li>
    <li>
      Geiger counter (be alerted when radiation starts getting severe)
    </li>
    <li>
      Microscope (study alien biology and minerals in the field)
    </li>
    <li>
      Advanced toolkit (take apart or repair complex equipment in the field)
    </li>
  </ul>

  <h4>
    Introductions
  </h4>
  <p>
    When you get here, wait for everyone else to catch up so you can do your
    introductions together.
  </p>
  <p>
    Go around the group. On your turn, introduce your Scientist by name and look,
    and tell the group what they know about you.
  </p>

  <h4>
    History
  </h4>
  <p>
    Go around the group again. When it's your turn, pick one of each for the
    other explorers.
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>
      This explorer is intimidated by your intellect
    </li>
    <li>
      This explorer doesn't understand half of what you say, but plays along
    </li>
    <li>
      This explorer almost died as a result of one of your experiments
    </li>
    <li>
      This explorer only cares about science that advances weapons and defenses
    </li>
    <li>
      This explorer took one of your classes in college
    </li>
    <li>
      This explorer recommended you for this job
    </li>
    <li>
      This explorer saved your life
    </li>
    <li>
      This explorer somehow always manages to destroy your samples or screw up
      your research
    </li>
    <li>
      This explorer always wants to be the first to try out new things that you
      develop
    </li>
  </ul>

  <h4>
    Luck
  </h4>
  <p>
    You can spend a point of Luck to either reduce any harm dealt to you to 0,
    or to change a roll to 12. Once all seven Luck boxes are marked, you are out
    of Luck.
