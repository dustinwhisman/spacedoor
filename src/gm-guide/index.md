  ## GM Guide

  As the GM, your responsibility is to create the world, portray its inhabitants
  (other than the PCs), create the scenarios and missions for the players to
  complete, and determine how the world reacts to the players. That sounds like
  a lot, but the key thing is listening and rolling with surprises.

  ### Playing the Game

  There is no script. As the GM, you should have enough details at the ready to
  make the world feel lived in, but it's up to the players to decide what to do
  and where to go. Your main job is to respect the players' choices and react to
  them in ways that are consistent with the world that you've built.

  As you keep playing, backstory, world-building, and mythology will develop
  naturally, and you can choose elements to weave back into the story. Listen to
  the players â€“ their actions will let you know what they're interested in. When
  you know what the players care about, you can use that to reward successful
  rolls or punish failed rolls.

  ### Don't Plan Ahead

  The explorers are responsible for what happens to them, not you. You will
  create the scenarios, and they should be detailed to the point that you know
  what would happen if the explorers never showed up. Once the explorers show
  up, everything is fair game, and their choices are what matters most.

  You want to plan just enough to be able to react to the explorers in a
  believable way. You can plant people, ruins, artifacts, or weapons for the
  explorers to find, but you have to be okay with letting them go if the
  explorers never find them, or decide to attack rather than help. You are only
  creating possible outcomes, not definite ones.
