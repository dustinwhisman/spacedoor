  ## Starting a Game

  Before your first session, you should talk to your players and ask them what
  they want out of the game. Once you have an idea of what the tone is, you
  should start prepping details about the world. Then, you can plan out your
  first session.
  
  ### Style and Tone

  Do you want a fun sci-fi/fantasy adventure type of game? Or would you prefer a
  gritty, hard sci-fi drama? Do the players want to play an ongoing campaign
  that builds to an exciting climax, or are they happy with a more episodic game
  with self contained stories?

  You should also check in with your players about any topics that should be
  considered out of bounds. You can also set up safety mechanisms so that
  players can stop things from going too far during a session.

  Once you've got a feel for the style and tone you're going for, you can
  research by watching movies or shows or reading books that are similar. These
  can be good for inspiration, but if you make your missions too similar to
  something popular, chances are your players will figure it out, so be careful
  with that.

  ### Basic World-Building

  You don't need to have everything planned out in advance, but you should at
  least nail down the specifics of how the Spacedoor was discovered, where it
  is, who controls it, and why your players' characters were chosen to go
  through it.

  Preparing some NPCs ahead of time to deliver exposition, provide services, or
  advance the plot is also a good place to start. If you know a little bit about
  the characters the players have created, you can use details about those
  characters to inform the world.

  Don't go too deep into it, though. Details will emerge from playing the game,
  so doing too much work upfront won't actually help all that much, and your
  plans for certain things will probably change over time.

  ### Creating Your First Mission

  The first scenario can be the most planned out, since it's when you'll be
  introducing the players' characters and establishing the general setting.
  Depending on how much your players have talked about characters before hand,
  you can introduce each character in their own scenes, have them all meet at
  the same time, or just go around the group, letting each player describe their
  character.

  The mission itself should have some basic elements to help give the players
  direction and focus. This applies to all missions, but especially the first
  one. You should have some or all of the following in mind:

  - A basic concept for the scenario
  - A hook, or objective, that the characters want to achieve at the beginning
    of the scenario (why are they going on the mission in the first place?)
  - Obstacles between explorers and the goal
  - People, aliens, or creatures that the characters might encounter
  - A ticking clock to bring some urgency into the story
