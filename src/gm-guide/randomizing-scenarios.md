  ## Randomizing Scenarios

  If you've got a fully formed idea for a mission, go for it. But if you've got
  writer's block or feel like you don't have any good ideas, you can try
  randomizing some facts about whatever world your players are going to explore
  and see if that generates some ideas for you.

  Using tables of different aspects of the world or environment, you can roll
  dice to determine what is true about the world. You can add to these tables if
  you like or use different aspects entirely – whatever helps get the ideas
  flowing.

  For each aspect, roll 1d6 and record the result according to the table. When
  you're done, look at the results and see if they inspire any ideas.

  ### Life

  This determines what sort of life and cultures your players may encounter.

  1. No intelligent life
  2. Primitive society – hunter-gatherer types
  3. Classical or medieval society – low technology
  4. Renaissance or industrial society – medium technology
  5. Modern society – roughly the same level as Earth
  6. Advanced society – advanced well beyond Earth

  ### Temperament

  This determines how the lifeforms will react to the players.

  1. Hostile – they attack with little provocation
  2. Fearful – they will either attack or hide when threatened
  3. Guarded – they don't immediately trust strangers
  4. Ambivalent – they don't particularly care about strangers
  5. Hospitable – their culture treats guests well
  6. Friendly – a stranger's just a friend you haven't met yet

  ### Alien Influence

  This determines how much interaction this world has with the more powerful
  alien forces in the galaxy.

  1. No alien influence – as far as they knew, they were alone in the universe
  2. Ancient influence – there are ruins and artifacts from long ago
  3. Weak influence – aliens may occasionally visit for good or bad reasons
  4. Strong influence – aliens have a presence here that may be reinforced at
    times
  5. Active presence – there are active conquests or infrastructure projects
    underway by aliens
  6. Home world – this is where alien societies or armies live, full-time

  ### Resources and Technology

  This determines the level of useful resources, technology, or general things
  of value that can be found on this world. Mostly, this is just a hook to
  justify the mission, but you can use it to inform aspects of the culture or
  environment. On a scale of 1 to 6, 1 is nothing useful at all, and 6 is tons
  of useful stuff just lying around.
