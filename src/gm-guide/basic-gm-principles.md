  ## Basic GM Principles

  Here are some best practices and principles to help guide you as a GM.

  ### Your Agenda as the GM

  - Make the world seem real, or at least engaging
  - Play to see what happens
  - Challenge your players
  - Make actions have consequences

  ### GM Principles

  - Not every planet will be Earth-like, and not every Alien will be humanoid
  - Use character names rather than player names
  - Be a fan of your players' characters
  - You don't need a fully detailed map – keep pieces of the setting vague and
    fill in the details as you go
  - The mythology of the world will build up as you play
  - Nothing is safe
  - Name everyone the players meet, and give them personalities
  - Ask questions and build on the results – don't just make your players roll
  - Sometimes give your players what they earned instead of what they wanted
  - Think about what's happening off-screen
  - It's not always your job to decide what happens
  - Anything can advance the plot
  - Prepare enough that you can throw your plans out the window and be fine
