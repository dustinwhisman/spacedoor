  ## Running Combat

  If you haven't read the rules for [combat](/how-to-play/combat), take a moment
  to get familiar. The challenge of combat will be in designing encounters that
  are balanced to your players. You need to prepare for how tough your bad guys
  are going to be, and you might even want to make them extra scary or
  challenging.

  ### Health

  Since your NPC villains are not super likely to stick around unless your
  players decide to try to capture or reform them, it's usually fine to just use
  one pool of health for each NPC, disregarding stamina. If the health pool runs
  out, the NPC dies without going through death saves.

  However, if an NPC involved in combat escapes or is let go, or otherwise
  manages to survive, you can recover some of their health in a way that feels
  right. You can roll for it or just give them a set amount based on the
  circumstances of their survival â€“ it's up to you how you want to handle that.

  The pool of health points is one of the main levers you can pull to make
  combat more or less challenging, so you can give an NPC a ton of health if you
  want them to challenge your players, or you can give them a small pool of
  health if you want to give your players a quick win.

  A rule of thumb that should work is to give low-level henchmen 1d6 of health
  per the average level of your players' characters. Bad guys that are more
  challenging can be given 2d6 per level, and super tough villains can get 3d6
  (or more) per level. If you don't want to bother with rolling for each NPC,
  you can just use a set amount of health per level, or assign the same rolled
  health to all the henchmen.

  ### NPC Weapons

  As the GM, you can invent weapons that the players don't have access to. They
  can have area of effect damage, highly concentrated damage on single targets
  or structures, or special effects unique to your game. This is another lever
  you can pull to make combat more or less challenging. You can give weak
  enemies strong weapons or vice versa, or you can create a boss battle where
  the big bad has a huge pool of health and deals massive damage.

  Take a look at the [weapons](/weapons) available to your players for ideas of
  how much damage is appropriate for the kinds of weapons you're designing.

  ### NPC and Lair Actions

  Other than just attacking the players, you can spice up combat by having your
  NPCs take other actions during combat. Depending on the NPC, that could
  include things like fleeing, arming a bomb, taking a hostage, or surrendering.

  Additionally, there can be events happening due to the environment during
  combat, like a structure collapsing, or a volcano erupting. Feel free to
  introduce mechanics for environmental hazards during combat and apply damage
  to anyone who gets caught up in it, including NPCs. To give players some sense
  of fairness, you can have them roll to see whether they avoid some
  environmental hazard and deal half or no damage depending on their rolls.

  ### Surprise Attacks

  Sometimes your NPCs get the drop on your players' characters or vice versa. If
  the players surprised the enemy or set a trap, they get a round of free
  attacks, meaning that the NPCs don't start taking turns until the second
  round.

  If the NPCs surprise the players, however, each NPC gets a free attack. As the
  GM, you can choose to roll for each NPC individually, or roll once and apply
  the damage to all of the players equally.

  Certain class feats or armor negate the effects of surprise attacks, so make
  sure the players remember if that applies to them.

  ### Handling Henchmen, Lieutenants, and Bosses

  To make keeping track of NPCs in initiative easier, you can divide your
  combatants into tiers and have each tier go at their own initiative. For
  example, if you have 4 henchmen, rather than rolling initiative for each of
  them, you can roll once and have them all go at the same time.

  Typical battles will have a mix of henchmen and lieutenants, weak and medium
  strength NPCs, respectively. In general, there should be more henchmen in
  these kinds of encounters.

  For tougher battles, you can increase the number of medium strength NPCs or
  add in a strong NPC. Adding more henchmen to make things harder can backfire,
  as it becomes organizationally challenging, and nobody wants their character
  to be killed by a grunt.

  For boss battles, a good mix would have no henchmen, but 2 or 3 lieutenants
  and the big bad. It could also just be one super strong NPC if you want, but
  having more combatants can help keep things interesting. It's helpful for
  there to be more than one goal in a combat to keep it from being a slog of
  rolling dice back and forth.

  ### Ending Combat

  If you can tell that your players are losing interest or it becomes clear that
  your NPCs no longer pose a threat to your players, you can have your NPCs
  surrender or try to escape. This helps prevent combat from dragging on, and
  then you can transition into interrogation or capture, moving on to the next
  scene.

  If it seems likely that one or more (or all) of the PCs are going to die, you
  can change tactics to keep the game from ending unceremoniously. You can have
  your bad guys capture the PCs or drop in some allies to save them. It all
  depends on the tone of your game and what would be fun (or not) for your
  players.
