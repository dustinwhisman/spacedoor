  ## Running Combat

  If you haven't read the rules for [combat](/how-to-play/combat), take a moment
  to get familiar. For the most part, you'll be rolling dice according to the
  players' rolls to deal damage back to them. That should be straightforward
  enough, but you need to prepare for how tough your bad guys are going to be,
  and you might even want to make them extra scary or challenging.

  ### Health

  Since your NPC villains are not super likely to stick around unless your
  players decide to try to capture or reform them, it's usually fine to just use
  one pool of health for each NPC, disregarding stamina. If the health pool runs
  out, the NPC dies without going through death saves.

  However, if an NPC involved in combat escapes or is let go, or otherwise
  manages to survive, you can recover some of their health in a way that feels
  right. You can roll for it or just give them a set amount based on the
  circumstances of their survival â€“ it's up to you how you want to handle that.

  The pool of health points is one of the main levers you can pull to make
  combat more or less challenging, so you can give an NPC a ton of health if you
  want them to challenge your players, or you can give them a small pool of
  health if you want to give your players a quick win.

  A rule of thumb that should work is to give low-level henchmen 1d6 of health
  per the average level of your players' characters. Bad guys that are more
  challenging can be given 2d6 per level, and super tough villains can get 3d6
  (or more) per level. If you don't want to bother with rolling for each NPC,
  you can just use 4 health per level, or assign the same rolled health to all
  the henchmen.

  ### NPC and Lair Actions

  Other than just fighting back at the players, you can have your NPCs take
  actions during combat as reactions to being attacked. Depending on the NPC,
  that could include things like fleeing, arming a bomb, taking a hostage, or
  surrendering.

  Additionally, there can be events happening due to the environment during
  combat, like a structure collapsing, or a volcano erupting. Feel free to
  introduce mechanics for environmental hazards during combat and apply damage
  to anyone who gets caught up in it, including NPCs.

  ### Surprise Attacks

  Sometimes your NPCs get the drop on your players' characters or vice versa. If
  the players surprised the enemy or set a trap, they get a round of free
  attacks, meaning that they don't take damage in return from failed or mixed
  success rolls.

  If the NPCs surprise the players, however, each NPC gets a free attack. As the
  GM, you can choose to roll for each NPC individually, or roll once and apply
  the damage to all of the players equally. Roll 2d6 and deal damage based on
  the result. A failure results in no damage, a mixed success deals 1d6 damage,
  and a success deals 2d6 damage. A critical success deals 4d6 damage.

  Certain class feats or armor negate the effects of surprise attacks, so make
  sure the players remember if that applies to them.
